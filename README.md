# Switch plate for 60% Layout

![](https://github.com/homerowco/60-mx-alps-universal-switch-plate/blob/master/DXF/60pct-mxalps-universal-combined-final.preview.png?raw=true)

 - ISO and ANSI support
 - Cherry MX and ALPS support
 - 16x7.2mm stab cut outs
 - NO Pok3r style screw holes!
 - NO split ANSI Enter!
 
The split ANSI Enter is rather rare so I assumed a more stable normal ANSI Enter would make more sense - to "enable" it you only need to remove the tow little pins that hold the right middle and bottom middle (ANSI Enter) switch in place on the right bottom.
The Pok3r style screw holes can easily be added by exporting them via Swills Builder and then overlaying it over the combined or open layer AI file. Let me know if I should do it for everyone.
